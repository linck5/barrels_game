
Procedurally generated mode:

Idea 1:
There would be a counter o barrels shot, and the dificulty would be increasing overtime. When the player loses, he would have the option to watch a video from unity api to start already halfway the barrel count and the difficulty from there on.

To think: Would he only be able to do this right after his run or anytime outside gameplay too?

This could go alongside with add popups at the end of the run. But they would appear only if it was not a highscore so the player don't get double frustrated with the video in the sequence.

Alternatively, the player could pay a certain ammount to get add free and always start halfway through.

Idea 2 (doesn't exclude first):
Cosmetic microtransactions?
